        <br><br>"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source

        in the Appendix below).
        <br><br>"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived
        from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall
        not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work
        and Derivative Works thereof.
        <br><br>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship,
        <br>including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative
        Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or
        by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
        definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or

        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        <br><br>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution
        has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
    </p>
    <p>2. Grant of Copyright License.</p>
    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
        Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative
        Works in Source or Object form.</p>
    <p>3. Grant of Patent License.</p>
    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
        to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
        applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
        submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
        lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
        contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
        terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
    <p>4. Redistribution.</p>
    <p>You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>
    <p>1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
    <p>2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</p>
    <p>3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
        trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
        to any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>
    <p>4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
        distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
        those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
        within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
        purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
        that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
        attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</p>
    <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license
        terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative
        Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the
        conditions stated in this License.</p>
    <p>5. Submission of Contributions.</p>
    <p>Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You
        to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
        conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
        license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
    <p>6. Trademarks.</p>
    <p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
        Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
        reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
    <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>
    <p>Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
        provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
        permissions under this License.</p>
    <p>8. Limitation of Liability.</p>
    <p>In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
        required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
        Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
        damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
        (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
        any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
        such damages.</p>
    <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</p>
    <p>While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
        acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
        responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
        each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
